# project_tracker
The goal of this project is to build an app that allows me to track my project ideas. Each idea will have its own preview card, and when you click on the card it will expand to show the rest of the project details. Ideally I will be able to mark the projects as completed or in progress as I start them. Additionally, I would like to be able to prioritize the projects or sort them based on a few different factors.

I would like to be able to use this app on my iPhone and I am currently learning Flutter so I will be trying to make this project with Flutter.
